## 1. ESP32 Video Doorbell

### **[Pitch Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B-0FBrOfQBRtXzIqesaLxJL4RIm_hf57/view)**

Project Lead: Junxiao Shi

<!-- Project Members: TBD -->
Prefered Team Size: 2

**Targeted participant**
- People new to NDN development

**How does your proposal benefit NDN?**
- Develop a video doorbell using two ESP32 modules programmed with Arduino environment. This would be a fun hands-on exercise for a new developer.

**Briefly describe the tasks**
1. Develop the display unit on an ODROID-GO handheld console.
Upon receiving and verifying a signed Interest, it plays a ringtone, and displays images retrieved from the camera unit.

2. Develop the camera unit on an AI Thinker ESP32-CAM module.
When a hardware button is pressed, it sends a signed Interest to the display unit to sound ringtone.
Upon receiving an Interest for image, it captures an image from the OV2640 camera and sends it as Data segments.

3. NDN library: https://github.com/yoursunny/esp8266ndn 
Camera library: https://github.com/yoursunny/ESP32-CAM-OV2640

**Any specific tools or language**
- Project author will loan 1x ODROID-GO, 1x ESP32-CAM, 1x USB-UART, 1x button. Each task needs 1 participant who can write C++.

**Expected outcomes**
- Finish all tasks.


## 2. Enhance Testbed Status Page and NDN-FCH Service

### **[Pitch Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uZ4E0OGr46p2PmnZemcZ8fJiSmjYMQ_4/view)**

Project Lead: Junxiao Shi

<!-- Project Members: TBD -->
Prefered Team Size: 3

**Targeted participant**
- People new to NDN development

**How does your proposal benefit NDN?**
- Provide better visibility into the availability of the global NDN testbed. Current status page http://ndndemo.arl.wustl.edu only shows node availability and routing reachability. Redesigned status page would detect data plane and prefix registration problems.  Make it easier for an end host to find an operational testbed router. ndn-autoconfig and NDN-JS should try multiple routers learned from NDN-FCH.

**Briefly describe the tasks**
1. Develop a backend service to (1) connect to a testbed router over UDP, TCP, and TLS-WebSocket, (2) send ndnping probes to every known destination, (3) register a prefix and check its propagation by sending ndnping probes from another router.
The results should be saved into a PostgreSQL database for accountability and analysis.

2. Develop a web application that shows the results from the database.

3. Develop an NDN-FCH compatible server that responds with routers with minimum downtime in the past 3 hours.
This server can directly connect to the database.

4. Modify ndn-autoconfig program to retrieve multiple routers from an NDN-FCH service, and try each only until establishing data plane reachability.
Also, ndn-autoconfig should try the WiFi access point as a potential NDN router, before executing NDN-FCH stage.

5. Modify NDN-JS Face class to use NDN-FCH service instead of trying to connect to *.ws.ndn.ucla.edu hostnames.

**Any specific tools or language**
- Backend, webapp, NDN-FCH tasks need 2 participants who can write Python. ndn-autoconfig task needs 0.5 participant who can write C++. NDN-JS task needs 0.5 participant who can write JavaScript.

**Expected outcomes**
- Finish all tasks.

Reference: BlePingClient.py in esp8266ndn repository.

5. L1
Study how different LoRa parameters affect signal range and packet loss rate.
Tune the existing LoRa transport to make it work better in indoor and outdoor environment.

**Any specific tools or language**
