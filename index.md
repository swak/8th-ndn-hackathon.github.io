title: Welcome to 5th NDN Hackathon
---

The NDN Team is organizing our 5th NDN Hackathon on December 16 and 17, 2017 on the University of California, Los Angeles campus.  We solicit Hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects.

We encourage projects that:

 - directly address NDN research needs,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
