title: Welcome to 6th NDN Hackathon
---

The NDN Team is organizing our 6th NDN Hackathon on May 12 and 13, 2018 at Florida International University.  We are soliciting Hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects.

We encourage projects that:

 - directly address NDN research needs,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
